# Frontend

The frontend provides a simple UI to view the Pokedex data.
It was written in React, and as of now is intended mostly as a testbed/playpen.

## Building

From within this directory, build and start up the UI with:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The home page will be visible at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).
Adjust the port and host information as needed for your environment.

## Testing
