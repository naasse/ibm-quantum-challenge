# Setup/Installation

## Prerequisites

Ensure you've installed the software outlined in the [prerequisites](https://github.com/naasse/ibm-quantum-challenge/blob/master/documentation/prerequisites.md) page.

## Database

Given ADR-1, our first setup task is to create our database.

We don't have any requirements about high-availability at this time, so let's spin up a small Docker pod with
MongoDB running there.

If we were going to make this into a production application,
we'd want a Linux host to either perform a native install of the Mongo server, or host pod(s) for us.

We're going to use the latest Mongo image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo).
I've created the configuration file to do it for me with Docker-Compose.
With this, we can also initialize our database on start.

In WSL, PowerShell, or wherever you've configured Docker,
change directory to the [Mongo](https://github.com/naasse/ibm-quantum-challenge/tree/master/mongo)
subdirectory and start the database with:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

After that, let's verify our collection has been created.

```bash
naasse@NASA:~$ mongo -u ash -p ketchum --authenticationDatabase pokedex
MongoDB shell version v3.6.3
connecting to: mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017
MongoDB server version: 4.4.0
WARNING: shell and server versions do not match

> db.pokemon.find().pretty()
{
        "_id" : ObjectId("5f3dd93d42cb09e10be25ddd"),
        "id" : "001",
        "name" : "Bulbasaur",
        "classification" : "Seed Pok√©mon",
        "types" : [
                "Grass",
                "Poison"
        ],
        ...
}
```

## API Framework

Next, we need to set up Loopback.io for our project.

This is handled for the consumer.
Simply building and starting up the Loopback server should work.

To allow for component scaffolding, you'll want to install the CLI.

```bash
npm i -g @loopback/cli
```

Then, from within the [api](https://github.com/naasse/ibm-quantum-challenge/tree/master/api) directory, start it up with:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The home page will be visible at [http://localhost:3210/](http://localhost:3210/)

If you want to verify that the database has been properly seeded and the API routes have registered, visit any of the actual endpoints.

```
GET     http://127.0.0.1:3210/pokemon/
GET     http://127.0.0.1:3210/pokemon/count
GET     http://127.0.0.1:3210/pokemon/{id}
DELETE  http://127.0.0.1:3210/pokemon/{id}
PUT     http://127.0.0.1:3210/pokemon/{id}/favorite
```

## Frontend

The challenge did not call for a frontend, but since we're pretty close to finishing the full stack, let's create a simple React UI.

From within the [frontend](https://github.com/naasse/ibm-quantum-challenge/tree/master/frontend) directory, start it up with:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The home page will be visible at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

## Postman

A [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) environment and collection was exported [here](https://github.com/naasse/ibm-quantum-challenge/blob/master/api/pokedex.postman.json.md) - import this to start working with the API manually.
