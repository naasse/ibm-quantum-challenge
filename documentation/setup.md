# Setup/Installation

## Prerequisites

Ensure you've installed the software outlined in the [prerequisites](https://github.com/naasse/ibm-quantum-challenge/blob/master/documentation/prerequisites.md) page.

## Database

Given ADR-1, our first setup task is to create our database.

We don't have any requirements about high-availability at this time, so let's spin up a small Docker pod with
MongoDB running there.

If we were going to make this into a production application, 
we'd want a Linux host to either perform a native install of the Mongo server, or host pod(s) for us.

We're going to use the latest Mongo image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo).
I've created the configuration file to do it for me with Docker-Compose.
With this, we can also initialize our database on start.

In WSL, PowerShell, or wherever you've configured Docker, 
change directory to the [Mongo](https://github.com/naasse/ibm-quantum-challenge/tree/master/mongo) 
subdirectory and start the database with: 

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

After that, let's verify our collection has been created. 

```bash
naasse@NASA:~$ mongo -u ash -p ketchum --authenticationDatabase pokedex
MongoDB shell version v3.6.3
connecting to: mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017
MongoDB server version: 4.4.0

{
        "_id" : ObjectId("5f3dd93d42cb09e10be25ddd"),
        "id" : "001",
        "name" : "Bulbasaur",
        "classification" : "Seed Pok√©mon",
        "types" : [
                "Grass",
                "Poison"
        ],
        ...
}
```

## API Framework

Next, we need to set up Loopback.io for our project.
