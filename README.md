  - Query pokemons with the options:
    - Pagination
    - Search by name
    - Filter by pokemon type
    - Filter by favorite
  - Query a pokemon by id
  - Query a pokemon by name
  - Query list of pokemon types
  - Mutation to mark/unmark pokemon as favorite

- **Tests** are important and if time allows it, we'd like to see _some_ test coverage.
